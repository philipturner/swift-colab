How Swift-Colab handles errors

## Runtime Crash

Improvement to stack trace happened (here), see (thread). Could still be improved by removing what's at top, but difficult because it required parsing the output at a high level, and could technically remove output that isn't part of the extraneous trace.

The above text is no longer accurate. Swift-Colab's error handling was overhauled in v2.1.
