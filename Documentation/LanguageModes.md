Why there needs to be a language mode. Ergonomics when building Swift-Colab, not getting self kicked off of Colab, being able to cache the toolchain and not disconnect and delete the runtime.

Switch modes when restart runtime, but saves the files

Hidden `--swift-colab-dev` mode switches between language modes on every runtime restart. Otherwise, you must change what's in `/opt/swift/runtime` to the desired language.

## Swift

`/opt/swift/runtime` accepts:

## Python

`/opt/swift/runtime` accepts:
