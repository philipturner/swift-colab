# Syntax Coloring

> This documentation page is a work in progress.

Swift-Colab works with any Jupyter notebook, but Swift ones are better. All code samples in docs aim to use Swift syntax coloring, even if in another language, because it mirrors what you will see in the notebook.

## Swift

Comes from Monaco editor "client-side" (link)

## Shell

Use parentheses when dealing with strings or numbers that are arguments, use parentheses liberally

## Python

This may be easier on the eyes:

```swift
#/*
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount(...)
#*/
```

vs

```swift
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount(...)
```
